# SchoolConnect

A Python tool for parents to scrape, store, and analyze student academic data from PowerSchool Parent Portal. Includes CLI tools, a SQLite database, and an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Automated extraction of grades, assignments, and attendance from PowerSchool
- **Local Database**: SQLite storage with views for analysis (grades, missing work, trends)
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for querying and generating reports
- **MCP Server**: AI agent integration via Model Context Protocol (works with Claude, etc.)
- **Weekly Reports**: Automated summary reports for each student

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)
- Playwright (for browser automation)
- Valid PowerSchool Parent Portal credentials

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd schoolconnect

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Install Playwright browsers and dependencies
uv run playwright install chromium
uv run playwright install-deps chromium
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your PowerSchool credentials:

```env
POWERSCHOOL_URL=https://your-school.powerschool.com
POWERSCHOOL_USERNAME=your-username
POWERSCHOOL_PASSWORD=your-password

# Optional: Enable debug HTML/screenshot dumps during scraping
SCRAPER_DEBUG=0

# Optional: Number of database backups to keep (default: 5)
DB_BACKUP_COUNT=5
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POWERSCHOOL_URL` | Your school's PowerSchool portal URL | Required |
| `POWERSCHOOL_USERNAME` | Parent portal username | Required |
| `POWERSCHOOL_PASSWORD` | Parent portal password | Required |
| `SCRAPER_DEBUG` | Set to `1` to dump HTML and screenshots to `raw_html/debug/` at each scraping step | `0` (off) |
| `DB_BACKUP_COUNT` | Number of timestamped database backups to retain in `db_backups/` | `5` |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Path to SQLite database file | `./powerschool.db` |

> **Security Note**: The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. Never commit credentials to git.

## Usage

### Initialize Database

```bash
# Create the database with schema and views
powerschool init-db

# Reset existing database
powerschool init-db --force
```

### Sync Data from PowerSchool

```bash
# Sync the currently selected student
powerschool sync

# Headless mode (no visible browser)
powerschool sync --headless

# Sync ALL students on the account (iterates through student switcher)
powerschool sync --all-students --headless

# Sync a specific student by name
powerschool sync -s "Daphne" --headless
```

Each sync automatically backs up the current database before overwriting it. Backups are stored in `db_backups/` with timestamps and rotated to keep only the most recent `DB_BACKUP_COUNT` copies.

### List Students

```bash
# Show students from the local database
powerschool students

# Query PowerSchool directly (opens browser, shows student number & ID)
powerschool students --live

# Live query in headless mode
powerschool students --live --headless
```

### View Grades

```bash
# Show current grades for a student
powerschool grades -s "StudentName"
```

The scraper extracts all grade columns from PowerSchool: Q1, Q2, F1, Q3, Q4, F2. Semester grades (F1/F2) are preferred over quarter grades (Q1-Q4) when available, since F1 covers Q1+Q2 and F2 covers Q3+Q4.

### Check Missing Assignments

```bash
# Show missing assignments for all students
powerschool missing

# Show for specific student
powerschool missing -s "StudentName"
```

### Generate Reports

```bash
# Generate weekly report for a student
powerschool report -s "StudentName"
```

### Database Status

```bash
# Show database statistics and student overview
powerschool status
```

### Action Items

```bash
# Show prioritized action items for a student
powerschool actions -s "StudentName"
```

### MCP Server (AI Integration)

```bash
# Start the MCP server for AI agents
powerschool serve-mcp
```

## Streamlit Chat Interface (SchoolPulse)

The project includes a Streamlit-based chat interface for interacting with student data using Claude AI.

### Streamlit Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the streamlit-chat directory
cd streamlit-chat

# Install dependencies (if not already installed via uv sync)
pip install streamlit anthropic python-dotenv
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root or `streamlit-chat/` directory:

```env
# Required for AI chat features
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Optional: Specify database path (defaults to ./powerschool.db)
DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/powerschool.db
```

### Running the App

```bash
# From the streamlit-chat directory
cd streamlit-chat
streamlit run app.py

# Or from project root
streamlit run streamlit-chat/app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Streamlit Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key for Claude | Required for AI features |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Path to SQLite database | `./powerschool.db` |

### Streamlit Features

- **Quick Actions**: One-click buttons for common queries (missing assignments, grades, attendance)
- **AI Chat**: Natural language conversation with Claude about student data
- **Model Selection**: Choose between Claude Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku models
- **Student Summary**: At-a-glance view of attendance rate, missing work, and course count

### Demo Mode

For testing without a real database, seed the database with test data:

```bash
cd streamlit-chat
python seed_data.py
```

Default demo credentials: `demo` / `demo123`

## Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run linter
uv run ruff check src/

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/
```

## Privacy and Security

This tool handles sensitive student data (FERPA protected). Best practices:

- Store `.env` credentials securely and never commit to git
- Database files (`.db`) contain PII - keep them local
- The `raw_html/` directory may contain scraped data - excluded from git
- MCP server custom queries are restricted to read-only operations on allowed tables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database errors:**

```bash
# Reset database
powerschool init-db --force
```

**Playwright browser errors:**

```bash
# Reinstall browsers
uv run playwright install chromium
```

**Login failures:**

- Verify credentials in `.env` file
- Check PowerSchool URL format (must include `https://`, no trailing slash)
- Try running with visible browser: `powerschool sync` (without `--headless`)

**Import errors:**

```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
uv sync
```

### Debug Mode

If scraping returns empty data or fails silently, enable debug mode to capture HTML snapshots and screenshots at each step:

```bash
# Set in .env or export directly
SCRAPER_DEBUG=1 uv run powerschool sync --headless
```

This saves files to `raw_html/debug/` with numbered prefixes showing the scraper's progression:

- `01_post_login.html/.png` — page state after login
- `02_before_goto_home.html/.png` — before navigating to home page
- `03_after_goto_home_networkidle.html/.png` — after page load
- `04_after_wait_for_content.html/.png` — after waiting for grades table
- `05_get_students.html/.png` — when parsing the student switcher

### Database Backups

Each sync automatically backs up the database before overwriting. Backups are in `db_backups/` with timestamps (e.g., `powerschool_20260410_171500.db`). To restore a backup:

```bash
cp db_backups/powerschool_20260410_171500.db powerschool.db
```
